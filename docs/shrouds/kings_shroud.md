## Description
This is custom EVA shroud inspired by the Voron Stealthburner and Paweł Kucmus's EVA Queen shroud and carriage platform. This shroud should be a drop-in replacement for any EVA 2.4 shroud. Features of this shroud include a hidden ADXL345 mount, dual Neopixel RGB LEDs for seeing what you're printing and a Neopixel RGB LED backlit EVA logo.

Because of all the wires this shroud requires, I've designed channels for the wires to fit into which will hide them from view.  The channel should have enough room for three 24awg wires, although I recommend using 28awg wires due to their flexibility.

The dual Neopixel LEDs at the bottom are mounted at an angle away and downward to better illuminate the part being printed.  This also keeps the LEDs from shining in your face.  

There is a back cover that will snap into place to seal the wires in.  There is a small opening for the wires to go out to a connector.  

#### Disclaimer
The names Voron, Stealthburner, EVA and Queen shroud are owned by their respective parties.

## Compatible EVA version

2.4 and newer.

## Print preparation

Print the KingsShroud_v176.stl face down on the bed in your primary color.  Note that these parts were designed to be printed with Petg and are a tight fit.  If printing in ABS, please adjust for shrinkage.

 - Use 4 perimeters, 5 top and bottom layers.

> **Note:** The are four 'Pokey Poke' holes that will need to be drilled out prior to assembly.

## Assembly instructions

#### Assembling the Logo LED Holder

Here are the printed parts for the Logo LED Holder.

![Stephen's King Shroud](assets/photo_LogoParts.jpg)

 - Press the EVA logo insert into the EVA Logo LED holder as shown in yellow below.

    ![Stephen's King Shroud](assets/InsertEVAlogo.jpg)

 - Press the EVA logo sheath onto the EVA logo LED holder as shown in yellow below.

    ![Stephen's King Shroud](assets/SheathAttached.jpg)

    Example of the assembled LogoLEDHolder

     ![Stephen's King Shroud](assets/photo_LogoHolderAssembled_sm.jpg)

 - Press the EVA logo LED holder into the back of the King Shroud body as shown in yellow below.  The part should press fit into the opening in the body.

#### Wiring the Neopixel (ws2812) LED harness

 ![Stephen's King Shroud](assets/photo_LEDwireharness.jpg)

I used 28awg stranded wire cut to the following lengths: 3x 100mm long, 3x 60mm long, and 3x as long as you need to go from the first LED in line to a connector outside the King Shroud, at least 60mm.

- Solder the wires from the outside three pin connector to the 'IN' pins on the first LED.
- Solder the three 100mm wires from the 'OUT' of the first LED to the 'IN' of the second LED.
- Solder the three 60mm wires from the 'OUT' of the second LED so they all are laying over the three wires going 'IN'.
- Solder the other ends of the three 60mm wires to the 'IN' of the last LED.  



#### Inserting the LEDs into the King shroud

 - Starting with the last LED, insert it into the bottom right side of the King Shroud with the wires pointing out.  Slide the LED disk into the channel making sure the square housing of the LED should fits nicely into the slot.  The square LED housing should slide all the way into the channel.  A small nub will keep the LED from falling out.

- Insert the next LED into the left side bottom.  Make sure the LED is oriented so that all the wires are sticking out from the body.  Carefully press the LED completely into the holder for it.

![Stephen's King Shroud](assets/photo_bottomLEDs.jpg)

- Using a small flathead screwdriver or Allen wrench, careful push the wires into the channels as shown below.

- Place the remaining LED into the Logo LED Holder.  Its wires should lay across in the small slot.

 ![Stephen's King Shroud](assets/photo_LogoLED.jpg)

-  Press the clip over the LED so that it clicks into place.  Here is a photo showing the wiring and clip in place.

#### Wiring the adxl345

 ![Stephen's King Shroud](assets/photo_adxl345.jpg)

Your ADXL345 will need to have its connector pin soldered in place.  Insert the pin on the side with the components and solder them in place from behind.  Attach the ADXL345 using the two 8mm M3 screws.  Carefully screw them into the threaded holes until they are tight.

Here is an example of the accelerometer mounted in place.

 ![Stephen's King Shroud](assets/photo_adxl345_mount.jpg)

#### Attaching the back wire cover

Take the wires that go to the connector and pass them through the opening in the back cover.


 > **Note:** The ADXL345 board has been removed for clarity but can be left in place for this next step.

 ![Stephen's King Shroud](assets/photo_connector.jpg)

Take the back cover and carefully lay it on the body.  There is a small grooved slot at the bottom that goes behind a tab above the bottom LED holders.  

 ![Stephen's King Shroud](assets/photo_backmount1.jpg)

Align the two upper tabs with the matching holes in the back and snap them into place.  They are circled in the photo below.

  ![Stephen's King Shroud](assets/photo_backpins.jpg)

Take the four M3 x 20mm screws and pass them through the front of the body.  Attach the toolhead fan to the four screws.  Place the entire assembly to your EVA carriage and attach it like you would any other shroud.

**Photo below is the completed assembly on a Rat Rig V-Core3 with a Bondtech LGX and Mosquito Magnum, and Euclid probe.**

## Klipper Macros

  My LEDs are driven by a BTT Octopus 1.1 board and I'm using the RGBLED port.  If you are using a different board or a different port, then make sure you change 'pin:' to whatever pin you're using.

  I'm controlling the LEDs with these simple macros in Klipper.  They can be copy/pasted into your printer.cfg below the Macros section.
